# MacroMu.Binary README

This package contains extension methods for numeric data types for the sake of binary and bit-level operations on numeric types.

Once included and referenced with a `using` directive, bytes, integers (short, long, signed and unsigned) will be able to be converted to byte arrays, or have their value changed by manipulating specific bits, and so on.
