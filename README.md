# MacroMu.Binary

## About the Project

This small helper library makes it easier to manipulate data at a bit level when working with numerics and booleans. In particular, this was created to help with a project where I needed to be able to read specific bits from bytes and manipulate bits within numerics.

## Using the Library

You can download and build the library currently. Adding it as either a project reference or referring to the built dll is all that is required- after all, this just contains static helper extensions.

## LICENSE

Distributed under the GPLv3. See LICENSE.txt for more information.
